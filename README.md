# Robot Project (Work in Progress)

##### Hi! This project involves a Raspberry Pi 4, an Adafruit servo/DC motor board, a small display, a Raspberry Pi camera, and two Adafruit LED strips for lighting control. The robot has four DC motors—one for each wheel—and two servos to control the camera movement.

##### Included in this repo are .stl files for 3D printing housings for the camera, LED strips, and the robot’s underbody to protect the motors. I will add a link soon for the robot frame and motor kit.

##### In the near future, I will also add the repository for a “Mission Control” interface that includes additional .stl files. It’s a very specific setup since I didn’t use a typical Pelican case; instead, I repurposed a watch case from the brand Unimatic. Hopefully, this inspires you to design something similar, or you can purchase a Unimatic watch case online.

##### The robot operates through a client web interface accessed at http://hostname.local:8000 using WebSockets. I use the hostname instead of an IP address to allow connection via a mobile hotspot when troubleshooting out in the field.

##### Coming soon: Getting Started, How to use, etc. Thanks for checking out the repo!
